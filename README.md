# Pasties

'Pasties' started as a small file used to collect random bits of information and scripts that were common to many individual tests.

Most of this is just a consolidation of publicly available information and things that Joe Vest (@joevest), Andrew Chiles (@andrewchiles), Derek Rushing, or myself (@minis_io) have found useful.

Over time additional sections, section placeholders, snippets, and links were added for "quick reference" and has grown to quite a sizable markdown file.

The more complex or longer sections will be separated into smaller more detailed write-ups; however, we decided to drop the short and generic info for public use now.  Pasties data will also eventually be formatted and added to the wiki.
